<!-- Key Info -->
<h3>Key Information:</h3>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of this research?</strong></p>
<p>We are asking you to be in a research study because we are trying to learn more about how simple interventions can decrease smartphone usage and understand natural smartphone behaviors. This study is being conducted by Muhammad Sameel Shahid, a graduate student at DePaul University, as a requirement to obtain his master’s degree. This research is being supervised by his faculty advisor, David Ramsay, PhD.</p>
<p>We hope to include about 50 people in the research.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you being asked to be in the research?</strong></p>
<p>You are invited to participate in this study because you are an Android smartphone user within the age range of 18-65. You must be age 18 or older to be in this study. This study is not approved for the enrollment of people under the age of 18.</p>

<!-- Study Involvement -->
<h3>What is involved in being in the research study?</h3>
<p>If you agree to be in this study, your participation will involve the following activities:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Creating Custom Experiments:</strong> You will be able to create a personalized set of experiments within the Mindful Monitor App. These experiments can include various interventions aimed at reducing your smartphone usage. There is no limit on the number of experiments you can create during this study. Examples of possible experiments include:
        <ul>
            <li>Setting screen time limits for specific apps.</li>
            <li>Enabling 'Do Not Disturb' mode to minimize distractions.</li>
            <li>Disabling Face ID or Thumbprint ID to make it more deliberate to unlock your phone.</li>
            <li>Moving "problem apps" to a distant screen in a folder to reduce impulsive usage.</li>
            <li>Changing your phone’s display to black and white (Grayscale) to make it less appealing.</li>
            <li>Setting app usage limits directly from your phone’s settings.</li>
            <li>Deleting certain apps for a day or a week to reduce dependency.</li>
            <li>Leaving your phone behind on intervention days to encourage more offline time.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Receiving Notifications:</strong> On intervention days, you will receive notifications reminding you to implement the interventions you have chosen.</li>
    <li><strong>Implementing Interventions:</strong> On these intervention days, you will adjust your phone settings according to the experiment you designed, such as enabling 'Do Not Disturb' mode or limiting app usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Providing Feedback:</strong> You will be asked to complete a short survey 30 days after you begin using the app. This survey will gather feedback on your experience and the effectiveness of the interventions you have implemented, regardless of whether you have completed your experiments or are still in the middle of one.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also collect data about your smartphone usage, specifically recording each event on your device with a timestamp, including when your screen is turned on, when your device is unlocked and locked, and when any application is opened and closed. This data will include information about the applications you are using and for how long. All this information will be anonymized and securely stored to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>Your participation in the study will continue for as long as you have the Mindful Monitor App installed on your device. If you wish to withdraw from the study and delete any or all of your data, you must first go to your account in the app and select 'Delete My Data' before uninstalling the application. If you uninstall the app without deleting your data first, the anonymized data already collected will be retained. This data will consist of the experiment details you entered, your device's unlock/lock times, and the names and durations of the applications you used.</p>

<p>There will be no audio or video recording involved in this study. We will not ask for any identifiable data from you, and we will not track your IP address.</p>

<p>This research does not involve any deception, non-full disclosure, or experimental tools that are not standard for this type of research.</p>

<!-- How it Works -->
<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<h4>1. Initial Survey and Intervention Beliefs:</h4>
<p>When you first launch the app, you'll be presented with an informed consent form, followed by a survey. This survey will ask you for some basic behavioral assessment and insights into your current smartphone usage habits. You'll also be asked to share your thoughts on various interventions, ranking them based on how effective you believe they might be in reducing your smartphone usage and how willing you are to try them.</p>

<p>After completing the survey, you'll be directed to the Dashboard, where you can begin creating your custom experiments. Setting up each experiment, including selecting the name, goal, schedule, and duration, typically takes an additional 5-10 minutes. Tool-tips are available throughout the setup process to guide you, ensuring you understand the importance of each choice.</p>

<h4>2. Selecting Your Schedule and Duration:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Schedule Options:</strong> Within the Mindful Monitor App, you will have the flexibility to choose how often you want to participate in the study. You can select from various schedule options (e.g., daily, every 2 days, or weekly).
        <ul>
            <li>For example, if you choose a daily schedule, you will engage with the interventions on alternate days; if you choose every 2 days, you will have an intervention day after every two days; and if you opt for a weekly schedule, interventions will occur in alternate weeks. The schedule you select determines how frequently you will receive notifications to implement the interventions.</li>
            <li>The default schedule is every 2 days.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Duration Options:</strong> You can also decide how long you want your participation in the study to last. The app offers different duration options (e.g., 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks).
        <ul>
            <li>For example, if you choose a 2-week duration, the study will apply the selected interventions for 2 weeks, tracking your phone usage and behaviors during this period. If you choose a longer duration, such as 6 or 8 weeks, the study will continue for that entire period, providing a more extended observation of your smartphone habits.</li>
            <li>The duration you select will determine how long the study will monitor your phone usage and apply the interventions, allowing enough time to observe meaningful changes in behavior. A longer duration helps ensure that any changes observed are due to the interventions rather than external factors.</li>
            <li>The default duration is 4 weeks.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Daily Participation:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>On the days you’ve scheduled interventions, the app will send you notifications reminding you to implement the selected actions (e.g., turning off notifications, using grayscale mode). Each day’s activity typically takes only 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>During control days (days without interventions), you will receive notifications reminding you that the next day will be an intervention day. This alternation between intervention and control days helps to measure the impact of the interventions on your smartphone usage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Customization and Tool-tips:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The app provides tool-tips (small ? icons) next to each field during the experiment setup process. These tool-tips explain the purpose and importance of each option you select. For example, the "Schedule Tool-tip" explains the need for 'normal' phone use on control days to compare against your usage during intervention days.</li>
    <li>Similarly, the "Duration Tool-tip" emphasizes the importance of running the experiment long enough to capture your phone habits across different days of the week, ensuring that any observed changes are due to the intervention and not other external factors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Monthly Survey and Reflection:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>At the end of each month, you will receive a survey that summarizes your phone usage statistics and asks several questions to help you reflect on your habits and consider changes. This survey will be conducted regardless of the length of your experiment (whether 2 weeks or longer).</li>
    <li>The survey includes questions about whether other factors might have influenced your phone habits and encourages you to consider running another experiment to further explore changes in behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the study, you will complete a maximum of 2 monthly surveys. The table below summarizes the timing of the surveys:</p>

<h4>6. Total Duration:</h4>
<p>The overall duration of your participation will depend on the schedule and duration you choose. It could span several weeks or up to 2 months (8 weeks), depending on your preferences. The estimated total time commitment is approximately 1-2 hours over the course of a month, but this could increase if you opt for longer or more frequent participation.</p>

<h3>Are there any risks involved in participating in this study?</h3>
<p>The risks involved in participating in this study are minimal. You may experience some minor inconvenience from receiving notifications on your smartphone as part of the interventions. Additionally, you might feel uncomfortable if the interventions prompt you to change your smartphone habits significantly.</p>
<p>There is also a potential, though minimal, risk of a breach of confidentiality. However, we have implemented several protections to prevent this from happening. All of your data will be anonymized using a randomly generated identification number, which means your data will not be directly linked to your identity.</p>
<p>If at any point you feel uncomfortable with the study, you have the right to withdraw without any consequences.</p>

<h3>Are there any benefits to participating in this study?</h3>
<p>You may benefit from participating in this study by potentially reducing your smartphone usage and improving your mindfulness through the interventions provided by the Mindful Monitor App. However, these benefits are not guaranteed and may vary depending on individual participation and engagement with the study.</p>
<p>The indirect benefits of this research include contributing to a better understanding of how simple interventions can reduce smartphone usage. The findings from this study may help others in the future by providing insights into effective methods for managing smartphone habits, which could be beneficial for broader public health and well-being.</p>

<h3>How much time will this take?</h3>
<p>This study will take about 5-10 minutes per day on the days you receive notifications and implement the interventions. Additionally, completing the survey, which occurs either at the first install or after a month, may take about 10-15 minutes. In total, the research procedures on intervention/experiment days will take up to 25 minutes.</p>

<h3>Other Important Information about Research Participation</h3>

<h4>Is there any kind of payment, reimbursement or credit for being in this study?</h4>
<p>Yes. Participants will receive a $20 Amazon gift card as a token of appreciation for their time and participation. This gift card will be sent electronically via email one month after the application download link is shared, regardless of whether participants complete the study.</p>

<h4>Can you decide not to participate?</h4>
<p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary, which means you can choose not to participate. There will be no negative consequences, penalties, or loss of benefits if you decide not to participate or if you change your mind later and withdraw from the research after you begin participating.</p>
<p>You may withdraw from the study at any time by requesting the deletion of your data through the Mindful Monitor App. It is important that you request the deletion of your data within the app before uninstalling it. If you delete the app without first requesting data deletion, your data will remain in our anonymized dataset, and we will not be able to link it back to you for removal, as all data is collected anonymously. Therefore, to fully withdraw and ensure your data is deleted, please make sure to request the deletion within the app before uninstalling it.</p>
<p>After you request data deletion through the app, your data will be permanently removed from our research database. Once you have confirmed the deletion, you can proceed to uninstall the app from your device. This process ensures that your privacy and data security are maintained throughout the study. Once you withdraw and delete the app, you will no longer be able to use the app.</p>
<p>If you decide to continue using the app after withdrawing from the study, any data you generate after withdrawal will not be used in the research. To ensure the integrity of the data collected during the study period, only data from participants who have fully consented and are actively part of the study will be included in the research. You have one full month to retroactively delete your data from the study period if you choose to withdraw.</p>
<p>Access to the data will be restricted to authorized research team members who have completed IRB training, and all data will be securely stored and anonymized to protect your confidentiality.</p>

<h4>Are there other options to my being in the research?</h4>
<p>Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You have the option to not enroll in this research. If you choose not to participate, you may consider other self-guided approaches to reduce smartphone usage, such as using built-in phone settings to limit screen time, seeking external resources like digital well-being apps, or consulting with a professional for personalized advice on managing smartphone habits.</p>

<h4>Who will see my study information and how will the confidentiality of the information collected for the research be protected?</h4>
<p>The research records will be kept and stored securely. Your information will be combined with information from other people taking part in the study. When we write about the study or publish a paper to share the research with other researchers, we will write about the combined information we have gathered. We will not include your name or any information that will directly identify you.</p>
<p>The data collected during this study will be stored initially on your Android device's local storage and subsequently transferred to a secure Google-managed cloud-based database. The data will be stored in electronic format, including app usage logs, survey responses, and other interaction data. To ensure confidentiality, all data will be anonymized using randomly generated identifiers and encrypted both on the device and during transmission.</p>
<p>When you launch the app and agree to participate in the study, a unique code is created just for you. This code is a long string of random letters and numbers, called a hash value. It is not connected to your identity, so no one can know who you are based on this code. This code allows you to have an anonymous account in our app, upload your data, and request to delete your data if you choose. We will not collect any personal information like your name or email address.</p>
<p>Access to the data will be restricted to authorized research team members who have completed IRB training. These members will only have access to anonymized data, ensuring that your identity remains protected. The DePaul University Institutional Review Board (IRB) may review the study records to ensure that the research complies with applicable rules, laws, and regulations. If they look at our records, they will keep your information confidential.</p>
<p>We will maintain an anonymized copy of the data you provide. If you wish to delete your data, you can request this through the app at any time. We will only use data that is 30 days old or older in publications, giving you one full month to decide whether you want to delete your data. If you uninstall the app without first requesting data deletion, your data will remain in our anonymized dataset, and we will not be able to link it back to you for removal, as all data is collected anonymously. This is why it's important to request data deletion within the app before uninstalling it.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we may be required by law to disclose your information to others. For example, the law may require us to show your information to a court or to inform authorities if you report information about a child being abused or neglected or if you pose a danger to yourself or someone else.</p>
<p>Your privacy and data security are of utmost importance to us, and we have put robust security measures in place to protect your information throughout the study.</p>

<h4>What if new information is learned that might affect my decision to be in the study?</h4>
<p>If we learn of new information or make changes to any portion of the study that might affect your willingness to continue participating, we will inform you as soon as possible. This could include new findings related to the interventions, changes in the app functionality, updates to the study procedures, or changes to the compensation process (e.g., eligibility for the $20 Amazon gift card) that may influence the risks, benefits, or incentives of the study.</p>
<p>In the event of significant changes, we may request your re-consent to continue your participation. This will be done through the mobile app. You will receive a notification within the app that outlines the new information or changes, and you will be prompted to review the updated consent form. You will not be able to skip this step, and app functionality will be paused until you provide your re-consent by electronically signing or selecting an option indicating your agreement.</p>
