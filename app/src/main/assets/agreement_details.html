<h2 style="text-align: center;">Evaluating Perception and Efficacy of User-Selected Interventions for Reducing Smartphone Usage</h2>

<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Muhammad Sameel Shahid, MSc, Graduate Student</p>
<p><strong>Institution:</strong> DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois, USA</p>
<p><strong>School, College:</strong> School of Computing, College of Computing and Digital Media</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> David Ramsay, PhD, School of Computing, College of Computing and Digital Media</p>

<h3>Key Information:</h3>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of this research?</strong></p>
<p>We are asking you to be in a research study because we are trying to learn more about how simple interventions can decrease smartphone usage and understand natural smartphone behaviors. This study is being conducted by Muhammad Sameel Shahid, a graduate student at DePaul University, as a requirement to obtain his master’s degree. This research is being supervised by his faculty advisor, David Ramsay, PhD.</p>

<p>We hope to include about 30 people in the research.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you being asked to be in the research?</strong></p>
<p>You are invited to participate in this study because you are an Android smartphone user within the age range of 18-65. You must be age 18 or older to be in this study. This study is not approved for the enrollment of people under the age of 18.</p>

<h3>What is involved in being in the research study?</h3>
<p>If you agree to be in this study, your participation will involve the following activities:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Creating Custom Experiments:</strong> You will be able to create a personalized set of experiments within the Mindful Monitor App. These experiments can include various interventions aimed at reducing your smartphone usage. There is no limit on the number of experiments you can create during this study. Examples of possible experiments include:
        <ul>
            <li>Setting screen time limits for specific apps.</li>
            <li>Enabling 'Do Not Disturb' mode to minimize distractions.</li>
            <li>Disabling Face ID or Thumbprint ID to make it more deliberate to unlock your phone.</li>
            <li>Moving "problem apps" to a distant screen in a folder to reduce impulsive usage.</li>
            <li>Changing your phone’s display to black and white (Grayscale) to make it less appealing.</li>
            <li>Setting app usage limits directly from your phone’s settings.</li>
            <li>Deleting certain apps for a day or a week to reduce dependency.</li>
            <li>Leaving your phone behind on intervention days to encourage more offline time.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Receiving Notifications:</strong> On intervention days, you will receive notifications reminding you to implement the interventions you have chosen.</li>
    <li><strong>Implementing Interventions:</strong> On these intervention days, you will adjust your phone settings according to the experiment you designed, such as enabling 'Do Not Disturb' mode or limiting app usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Providing Feedback:</strong> You will be asked to complete a short survey 30 days after you begin using the app. This survey will gather feedback on your experience and the effectiveness of the interventions you have implemented, regardless of whether you have completed your experiments or are still in the middle of one.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also collect data about your smartphone usage, specifically recording each event on your device with a timestamp, including when your screen is turned on, when your device is unlocked and locked, and when any application is opened and closed. This data will include information about the applications you are using and for how long. All this information will be anonymized and securely stored to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>Your participation in the study will continue for as long as you have the Mindful Monitor App installed on your device. If you wish to withdraw from the study and delete any or all of your data, you must first go to your account in the app and select 'Delete My Data' before uninstalling the application. If you uninstall the app without deleting your data first, the anonymized data already collected will be retained. This data will consist of the experiment details you entered, your device's unlock/lock times, and the names and durations of the applications you used.</p>

<p>There will be no audio or video recording involved in this study. We will not ask for any identifiable data from you, and we will not track your IP address.</p>

<p>This research does not involve any deception, non-full disclosure, or experimental tools that are not standard for this type of research.</p>

<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<h4>1. Initial Survey and Intervention Beliefs:</h4>
<p>When you first launch the app, you'll be presented with an informed consent form, followed by a survey. This survey will ask you for some basic behavioral assessment and insights into your current smartphone usage habits. You'll also be asked to share your thoughts on various interventions, ranking them based on how effective you believe they might be in reducing your smartphone usage and how willing you are to try them.</p>

<p>After completing the survey, you'll be directed to the Dashboard, where you can begin creating your custom experiments. Setting up each experiment, including selecting the name, goal, schedule, and duration, typically takes an additional 5-10 minutes. Tool-tips are available throughout the setup process to guide you, ensuring you understand the importance of each choice.</p>

<h4>2. Selecting Your Schedule and Duration:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Schedule Options:</strong> Within the Mindful Monitor App, you will have the flexibility to choose how often you want to participate in the study. You can select from various schedule options (e.g., daily, every 2 days, or weekly).
        <ul>
            <li>For example, if you choose a daily schedule, you will engage with the interventions on alternate days; if you choose every 2 days, you will have an intervention day after every two days; and if you opt for a weekly schedule, interventions will occur in alternate weeks. The schedule you select determines how frequently you will receive notifications to implement the interventions.</li>
            <li>The default schedule is every 2 days.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Duration Options:</strong> You can also decide how long you want your participation in the study to last. The app offers different duration options (e.g., 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks).
        <ul>
            <li>For example, if you choose a 2-week duration, the study will apply the selected interventions for 2 weeks, tracking your phone usage and behaviors during this period. If you choose a longer duration, such as 6 or 8 weeks, the study will continue for that entire period, providing a more extended observation of your smartphone habits.</li>
            <li>The duration you select will determine how long the study will monitor your phone usage and apply the interventions, allowing enough time to observe meaningful changes in behavior. A longer duration helps ensure that any changes observed are due to the interventions rather than external factors.</li>
            <li>The default duration is 4 weeks.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Daily Participation:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>On the days you’ve scheduled interventions, the app will send you notifications reminding you to implement the selected actions (e.g., turning off notifications, using grayscale mode). Each day’s activity typically takes only 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>During control days (days without interventions), you will receive notifications reminding you that the next day will be an intervention day. This alternation between intervention and control days helps to measure the impact of the interventions on your smartphone usage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Customization and Tool-tips:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The app provides tool-tips (small ? icons) next to each field during the experiment setup process. These tool-tips explain the purpose and importance of each option you select. For example, the "Schedule Tool-tip" explains the need for 'normal' phone use on control days to compare against your usage during intervention days.</li>
    <li>Similarly, the "Duration Tool-tip" emphasizes the importance of running the experiment long enough to capture your phone habits across different days of the week, ensuring that any observed changes are due to the intervention and not other external factors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Monthly Survey and Reflection:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>At the end of each month, you will receive a survey that summarizes your phone usage statistics and asks several questions to help you reflect on your habits and consider changes. This survey will be conducted regardless of the length of your experiment (whether 2 weeks or longer).</li>
    <li>The survey includes questions about whether other factors might have influenced your phone habits and encourages you to consider running another experiment to further explore changes in behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the study, you will complete a maximum of 2 monthly surveys. The table below summarizes the timing of the surveys:</p>

        <td>Ongoing/Multiple Experiments</td>
        <td>At the end of each month, with a maximum of 2 monthly surveys throughout the study</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>6. Total Duration:</h4>
<p>The overall duration of your participation will depend on the schedule and duration you choose. It could span several weeks or up to 2 months (8 weeks), depending on your preferences. The estimated total time commitment is approximately 1-2 hours over the course of a month, but this could increase if you opt for longer or more frequent participation.</p>
