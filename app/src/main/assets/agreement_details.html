<b>Welcome to the Mindful App!</b><br/><br/>
<b>Study Information and Consent Agreement</b><br/><br/>
Thank you for downloading the Mindful App. This application is part of a research study led by <b>Sameel Shahid</b> from <b>DePaul University</b>. The study aims to identify which interventions you think will influence your smartphone usage and measure their impact.<br/><br/>

<b>Purpose of the Study</b><br/>
The aim of this study is to explore how simple interventions can decrease smartphone usage. These interventions include turning the screen color to grayscale, turning off notifications, and charging the smartphone outside of the room. Additionally, we seek to understand natural smartphone behaviors. Your participation will offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of these interventions. We may follow up with a monthly survey to inquire about smartphone usage during non-experimental periods.<br/><br/>

<b>What You Will Do</b><br/>
<i>Create Custom Experiments:</i> You will create personalized experiments within the app that include various interventions aimed at reducing smartphone usage.<br/>
<i>Receive Notifications:</i> On intervention days, you will receive notifications reminding you to implement the interventions.<br/>
<i>Implement Your Experiment:</i> On intervention days, you will adjust your phone settings according to the experiment you designed.<br/>
<i>Provide Feedback:</i> You will be asked to complete surveys about your experience and the effectiveness of the interventions.<br/><br/>

<b>Duration</b><br/>
Your participation will last for the duration you select when creating the experiment. You may delete the app at any time and withdraw from the study whenever you choose.<br/><br/>

<b>Confidentiality</b><br/>
Your data will be kept confidential and securely stored. All collected data will be anonymized, ensuring no identifiers link it directly to you. A randomly generated string will be used to connect your data securely to your phone, stored on our servers.<br/><br/>

<b>Data Anonymization</b><br/>
The data we collect will be anonymized to protect your identity. No personal identifiers will be retained that could link the data back to you.<br/><br/>

<b>Data Security and Sharing</b><br/>
Your personal data will remain confidential and will not be shared in its raw form outside of the DePaul research team and academic affiliates who have completed IRB training. For scientific research purposes, the data will be shared in an aggregated and summarized form with other users' data.<br/><br/>

<b>Data Removal</b><br/>
You may request the removal of your data at any time from within the app. If you do so, we will delete your data. However, if you delete the app or log out, the link between your data and your identity will be lost and you will no longer be able to request its deletion.<br/>
For research and analysis purposes, we will take a snapshot of the full dataset once a month. You have this month to request deletion before your data is used in aggregate with other users for publications.<br/><br/>

<b>Data Collection</b><br/>
Below is an example of the data we collect using our application:<br/>
- App usage statistics (e.g., screen time of Apps, Device unlock/lock, Screen On/Off)<br/>
- Participant interactions with the app (e.g., experiment creation, response to notifications)<br/>
- Survey responses regarding the effectiveness and user experience of the interventions<br/>
This data helps us provide insights into how you engage with your phone, how you switch tasks, and the amount of time you spend on specific applications.<br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary Participation</b><br/>
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without any repercussions. If you choose to end your participation and wish to have your data removed, please use the 'Withdraw and Delete My Data' button within the application to indicate your request.<br/><br/>

<b>Risks and Benefits</b><br/>
<i>Risks:</i> Minimal risks are involved, such as minor inconvenience from receiving notifications.<br/>
<i>Benefits:</i> Potential benefits include reduced smartphone usage and improved mindfulness.<br/><br/>
